File names must be all lowercase and may include underscores (_) or dashes (-), but no additional punctuation. Follow the convention that your project uses. Filenamesâ€™ extension must be .ts for typescript files.

use Camel Case (aka Upper Camel Case) for classes: VelocityResponseWriter
use Mixed Case (aka Lower Camel Case) for variables: studentName
use Upper Case for constants : MAX_PARAMETER_COUNT = 100
use Camel Case for enum class names and Upper Case for enum values.
`don't use '_' anywhere except constants and enum values (which are constants).`
